# MacBook 3D Model with Scroll Animation

This project showcases a 3D model of a MacBook, where the screen dynamically animates based on the scroll position. As users scroll, the MacBook screen smoothly opens and closes, providing an engaging interactive experience.

The website is built using **React**, **Three.js**, **React Three Fiber**, and **React Three Drei**, ensuring a smooth and immersive animation experience.
